# MultiCore

**MultiCore** is a Python package for **multi**-**co**ntrast **re**construction of magnetic resonance images (MRIs).  Powered by [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/), this library is designed to exploit parallel computing on *multi-core* processors -- whether in the form of CPUs or GPUs -- to maximally accelerate reconstruction time.  MultiCore is also equipped with [TensorBoard](https://www.tensorflow.org/tensorboard) support, so that users may view images and track metrics as reconstruction takes place.
